VELOCITY OBSTACLE


Implemented CC based collision avoidance algorithm in ROS Gazebo. Two quadrotors were spawned in the Gazebo environment such that they are in a collision configuration as shown in the first two figures.
Since VAB lies inside the CC, it is in the collision geometry. To come out of this collision geometry, as VAB is closer to the right side tangent, agent A is guided such that it turns towards its right side, so that VAB comes outside the CC.
